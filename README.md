# Timeseries-Charts-Application

![Screenshot](screenshot.png width="180")

#### I have developed this application as a part of exercise to gain an understanding and get familiar with the logic, syntax, control flow and architecture of FARM stack. 

#### Firstly, I extracted a suitable time series dataset from Kaggle. The dataset had pretty issues related to consistency, completeness and validity. I worked on data cleaning for improving the data quality and then imported refined dataset into Mongodb.

#### Secondly, I have worked on backend with FastAPI and Mongodb in order to create API's, then I started building UI charts with React. Furthermore, I established connection between the frontend and backend to come up with fully functional FARM Stack application.



### Tech Stack Used:
1. FastAPI
2. Pandas
3. React JS
4. MongoDB
